The System for AI Lab (SAIL) at Georgia Tech, led by Prof. Alexey Tumanov, specializes in advancing systems support and resource management for machine learning (ML) to democratize large-scale AI systems. Our research encompasses the entire AI infrastructure stack, from foundational system design to the development of efficient ML training and inference algorithms. By focusing on managing the complete ML lifecycle, SAIL aims to enhance accessibility and efficiency in AI technologies.
