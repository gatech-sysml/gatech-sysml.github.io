Hi! I am a first-year MSCS student at Georgia Tech, specializing in Computing Systems. My research interests include systems optimizations for emerging ML workloads, with a focus on performance, scalability, and hardware–software co-design.

Prior to this, I worked as a Software Engineer at Pure Storage, where I contributed to the development of cloud-native data protection solutions. My work involved enabling backup and restore of on-premises k8s deployments, implementing CI/CD-based test automation, and improving product installation and upgrade workflows.

I received my B.Tech in Computer Science from PES University in 2023. During this time, I interned with Prof. Biswabandan Panda at IIT Bombay, conducting research on criticality–based hardware prefetching techniques for bandwidth-constrained scenarios.
